    <p class="h3">Puzzle Hunts</p>

    <p class="lead">I write puzzle hunt puzzles, and even sometime small puzzle hunts sometimes. Here are some of the more presentable ones I have done over the years, in reverse chronological order, so the better ones are on top.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://files.timwi.de/Puzzles/Secret%20Solver%202022/Adalbert/index.html">Adalbert Zollern's Christmas Mishap</a> (2022, 6 Feeders + 1 Meta), my Secret Solver 2022 present to Adalbert Zollern.</p>  
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://kusanehexaku.github.io/kusane-minihunt-1/">Kusane's Mini Puzzle Hunt 1</a> (2020, 10 Feeders + 1 Meta), or as I sometimes call it, The College Assignment Hunt, because it was started for an assignment.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/cBzcObI">The Concise Trickeries Compilation</a> (2020, 6 Feeders + 1 Meta), a micro hunt made for the Cracking The Cryptic Discord server.</p>

    <p class="h3">Logic Puzzles</p>

    <p class="lead">I can and will make logic puzzles. Shocker. Here are the two main place you'll see them:</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://puzsq.logicpuzzle.app/?author=2298">PuzzleSquare JP</a> - For standard logic puzzles. Not that frequent of a post, but they're there.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Benutzer/eingestellt.php?name=KusaneHexaku">Logic Masters Deutschland</a> - For my more gimmicky puzzles and one-offs, such as mashups or variant heavy puzzles</p>
    <p class="lead">I also like trying to come up with a new genre and mostly failing or clashing with an existing thing. <br><a href="originalgenres/index.html">You can see the successful-ish ones here.</a></p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Escape Rooms</p>

    <p class="lead">I also very occasionally upload custom escape rooms for Escape Simulator! <br>They still very much has that tangy hunt flavour to them, but it's been mostly adjusted for non-hunt escape room goers.</p>
    <p class="lead">Some selected example of my rooms:</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2641333780">The Unusual Room</a></p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2651953103">Incomplete Information</a> (2-player Co-Op only!)</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823211037">Kusane Hexaku's Quick Distractions - Knapp Daneben</a>, less of an escape room, more of a collection of logic puzzles themed around the Knapp Daneben gimmick.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/KusaneHexaku/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1435790&sort=score&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall">Full list of my ES rooms</a></p>  
    <p class="lead">&#11041; I also sometimes show up in Collab rooms. Not in a major role, but I'm usually there.</p>

    <p class="h3">Other Puzzle-Adjacent Content</p>

    <p class="lead">&#11043; There's this cool free-to-play UGC-based game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114940/I_Wanna_Maker/">I Wanna Maker</a> on Steam. I make levels in there.<br>Naturally, some of them have puzzles.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; If you ever play it, just look for levels made by a player called "Kusane". Most of them have thoughts went into them. <br>I recommend Puzzler's Delight 3</p>

</div><br><hr /><br><br>


<a id="notPuzzleContent-top"><p class="h1">Not Puzzle Related Stuff</p></a><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">I Wanna Maker Levels</p>
    <p class="lead">A lot of them end up being puzzle-adjacent, but most of them don't.<br> In fact, if you play the Campaign mode, three of those levels are mine. Feel free to guess which one!</p>
    <p class="lead">Or you can just, you know, read the credit that unlocks once you beat the Campaign.</p>
    <p class="lead">You can find them under the account "Kusane".</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Geometry Dash Levels</p>
    <p class="lead">Yeah, I tried. It's hard to finish like, a proper level that isn't a meme.</p>
    <p class="lead">I have some WIPs that are like, proper levels. For now the ones I have online are memes.</p>
    <p class="lead">You can find them under the account "RealKusane". That should speak of what era of GD was I most active in.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Online gameshows & quizzes</p>
    <p class="lead">I like making and hosting them. Some of it are existing formats, while some are original.<br> The remnants of them exists, but they're tricky to find.</p>
    <p class="lead">Big fan of gameshows and quizzes in general. Love watching them, love writing them, not good at actually being competent at them.</p>
    <p class="lead">You can find them in various Discord servers. Some are public, some are invite-only. You basically had to be there.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Rhythm Heaven adjacent</p>
    <p class="lead">I did one Polyrhythm Mania level. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/ain8OJ51e-0">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="lead">Maybe I'd do some Heaven Studio stuff in the future. If I can think of any songs that hasn't been used.</p>
    <p class="lead">You can find them... I guess on my Youtube page? It'd make sense to upload a video there.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Solitaire</p>
    <p class="lead">I came up with a decently original Solitaire-like variant called "Double-Sided Solitaire". Will add rule pages later.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Miscellaneous Games</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; HopLock - A simple paper or board game, where player jumps around the board trying to trap each other. Will add rule page later.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">The Rest of Them</p>
    <p class="lead">Many other things that I don't recall being remarkable enough to be worth writing down. Will add when remembered.</p>

</div><br><hr /><br><br>


<a id="notContent-top"><p class="h1">Other Things</p></a><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">I play Minecraft</p>
    <p class="lead">Yeah, I really do. My preferred side of the game is Redstone. I'm leaning more Practical Redstone, but I do enjoy making Redstone minigames.</p>
    <p class="lead">I really don't have many servers I often, so most of the time when I do play I might be on DiamondFire. Great server, not sponsored.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">I play Minesweeper</p>
    <p class="lead">More specifically, minesweeper.online. I don't grind as much as I used to, but I'll be on there occasionally.</p>
    <p class="lead">Feel free to say Hi. Maybe if it's a Friend Quest month, we can trade quests.</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">I am really bad at getting things done</p>
    <p class="lead">Just look at the latest commit of this page.</p>

</div><br><hr /><br><br>


<div class="container">  
   <p class="lead">Anyway yeah that's it really. Do not expect frequent updates to this page. It's weird writing about yourself.</p>
   <p class="lead">If you somehow really need to know more about me, I recommend Discord. It's the one thing I actually check daily.</p>
