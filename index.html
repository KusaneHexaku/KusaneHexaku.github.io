    <p class="h3">Puzzle Hunts</p>
    <p class="lead">I write puzzle hunt puzzles, and even sometime small puzzle hunts sometimes. Here are some of the more presentable ones I have done over the years, in reverse chronological order, so the better ones are on top.</p><br>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://files.timwi.de/Puzzles/Secret%20Solver%202022/Adalbert/index.html">Adalbert Zollern's Christmas Mishap</a> (2022, 6 Feeders + 1 Meta), my Secret Solver 2022 present to Adalbert Zollern.</p>  
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://kusanehexaku.github.io/kusane-minihunt-1/">Kusane's Mini Puzzle Hunt 1</a> (2020, 10 Feeders + 1 Meta), or as I sometimes call it, The College Assignment Hunt, because it was started for an assignment.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/cBzcObI">The Concise Trickeries Compilation</a> (2020, 6 Feeders + 1 Meta), a micro hunt made for the Cracking The Cryptic Discord server.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="h3 ">Less conventionally hunt puzzle but still puzzle hunt adjacent</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; The "A Puzzler's Delight" series of levels on I Wanna Maker, a free-to-play user-geneated content-based level creation game. Anyway, they're like, somewhere between a puzzle hunt and an ARG in terms of structure, but the puzzles are definitely hunt-like.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; A Puzzler's Delight 1 (NAJ9-9UEJ), released in February 2020, was an experiment in making and introducing a different style of "puzzle level" to the crowd. It was not good.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; A Puzzler's Delight 2 (N9AQ-J93Q), released in late 2020 is a return to form for A Puzzler's Delight, with an improved and more sensible structure, along with bigger, better, and more diverse puzzles.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; A Puzzler's Delight 3 (RSCU-X8G1), released in late 2022 after being worked on since mid 2021, is the biggest return of the Puzzler's Delight series yet, with puzzles and structures that hunters shouldn't find too unusual, but is definitely not suitable for the typical platformer players.</p><br>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; On the topic of I Wanna Maker, my part in the The Fairlight Collab Project (9NMB-UCXX), a collab between 18 creators, hosted by Koharu (formerly Fairlight), with some of the most brutally difficult yet amazing levels with some of the tightest platforming that can give Celeste a run for its money.</p>
    <p class="lead">Anyway, I'm not good enough at the game to make a level on the same level as the rest of the team (and verify it myself), so I thought about how can I make up for my shortcoming, and I came to the conclusion that I should utilise my strong point -- puzzles.</p>
    <p class="lead">Honestly, I'm surprised I was allowed to get away with it. Probably because it was funny to do some insane platforming, and then suddenly there's just a konundrum interlude. Yes, I did indeed end my part with a konundrum. A cool one, though.</p>

<div class="container">
    <p class="h3">Primarily non-hunt puzzles</p>
    <p class="lead">I have also written puzzles that are not hunt puzzles. Most of them were posted online once, and then lost to time to never be seen again. Although I have been putting some of those on my LMD page, along with newer ones.</p>
    <p class="lead">While I do sometimes write normal stuff, my bread and butter is gimmicks and mashups, as evidently by what I've elected to post on there so far.</p>  
    <p class="lead">&#11043; <a href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Benutzer/eingestellt.php?name=KusaneHexaku">List of Puzzles I've posted on LMD</a></p><br>
    <p class="lead">I also very occasionally upload custom escape rooms for Escape Simulator! They still very much has that tangy hunt flavour to them, but it's been mostly adjusted for non-hunt escape room goers.</p>
    <p class="lead">Rooms I'd recommend you check out (from the verly limited pool):</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2641333780">The Unusual Room</a></p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2651953103">Incomplete Information</a> (2-player Co-Op only!)</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823211037">Kusane Hexaku's Quick Distractions - Knapp Daneben</a>, less of an escape room, more of a collection of puzzles themed around the Knapp Daneben gimmick.</p>

    <p class="h3">Other stuffs that are not puzzles, or at the very least least than 20% puzzle</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; I guess all of my other I Wanna Maker levels. As of writing this (Feb 2, 20230, I haven't touched it in a while, let alone uploading another levels, but I have been looking for an excuse to get back to it.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; I also enjoy writing and hosting "original" gameshows. My current forefront format is "BlockWalkers", a comedy-leaning quiz and gameshow. 2 episodes was ran on a Discord server for a group of friends that signed up for it, and it went pretty well.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11041; Oh yeah, I love trivia and gameshows. Can't get enough of 'em. Only Connect & Countdown gang.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; I also like Rhythm Heaven, so there's that. I'm a Lockstep liker, and my favourite remix is DS Remix 8.</p>
</div><br><br> 
    <div class="container">  
   <p class="lead">Anyway yeah that's it really. Do not expect frequent updates to this page. Get in touch with me on Discord (Kusane#8864), it's easier that way.</p>
