    <p class="h3">Rules</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Draw a single non-branching loop that visits all regions at least once.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Regions with the same letter must contain the same set of completely identical loop segments with no rotations or mirroring, but not necessarily in the same relative positions.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Regions with different letters must contain at least one differing loop segment.</p>

    <p class="lead">It's a genre that's very inherently tricky --- both to solve, but especially to set.</p>
    <p class="lead">Nevertheless, I very much enjoy the almost NIKOJI-like logic of it. It hasn't catch on yet, but one day I hope it will.</p>

<div class="container">

    <p class="h3">Rules</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Divide the grid into regions, each containing zero or one clue cell.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Numbers indicate the size of the region it's in.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Regions with a Diamond must share an edge with at least one other region of the same shape, rotation and mirroring included.</p>
    <p class="lead">&#11043; Regions with a Square may not share an edge with any region of the same shape, but must share a corner with at least one other region of the same shape, rotation and mirroring included.</p>

    <p class="lead">This ruleset went through quite a bit of modification comparing to its initial form,</p>
    <p class="lead">particularly the Corner touch rule, due to some interesting edge cases brought up by testsolvers.</p>
    <p class="lead">This doesn't really have any relations to Gemini Flushed, but when I was considering a name for this genre,</p>
    <p class="lead">two regions of the same shape touching can kinda be described as "twin regions", thus the Gemini-ness.</p>
    <p class="lead">It also rhymes, which helped with the decision.</p>
