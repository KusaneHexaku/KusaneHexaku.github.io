        <p class="mb-0">This is a multi-stage puzzle consisting exclusively of puzzles involving physical items. The physical items for these puzzles are no longer available, but we have modified our answer checker to simply accept the puzzle titles like how it would've had accepted answers.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="mb-0">The first puzzle involves a package that solvers were able to <i>order</i> from the Workshop HQ. The package consists of a black metal bottle, and five plastic bottles each containing a clear liquid of different flavour. Once solvers have identified the flavours of the drinks and solve the puzzle on the metal bottle, they are then instructed to figure out the brand of the drinks they just had.</p>
