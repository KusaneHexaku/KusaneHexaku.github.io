<br>
Puzzle 0 is made as an alternative to finding me.<br>
(Context : During the first hour after the hunt was officially launched, I was standing in a server waiting for someone to come find me, and I would direct them toward the first location, which is the same if you had solved this puzzle instead.)<br>
        Each entry in the list is an anagram of something, but with an extra letter. If you remove all the extra letters, they should be able to be anagrammed back into something that belong to the same group.<br>
        And by the same group, I mean that these are all names of <b>Nijisanji Livers</b>.<br>
        Taking all the extra letters in order spells the phrase "COMMUNITY HOUSE".<br><br>
