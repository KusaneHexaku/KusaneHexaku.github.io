<br>
    During the first hour after the hunt was officially launched, I posted a screenshot showing me standing somewhere in a server waiting.<br>
    If they figure out where I was and come find me, I would direct them toward the first location, and they would get to skip solving this puzzle.<br><br>

        Each entry in the list is an anagram of something, but with an extra letter. If you remove all the extra letters, they should be able to be anagrammed back into something that belong to the same group.<br>

There are renamed coloured wool scattered all over the place. Each of them has a 2-letter name.<br>
      Inside the house, there is a section with a multicoloured "carpet".<br>
      The colours on the carpet matches the colour we found. Reordering them based on the colour order that isn't out.<br>
      Note that the position of each wool might get shuffled around, though the location of the wool has no impacts.<br>

Hidden below the stair, there is a furnace visible through a tiny gap through the staircase. Inside it is a book that tells you where to go next.

    I decided to start it off focusing more on the scavenger hunt side than the puzzle side to give everyone an equal footing start.<br>
    I did try to ease into puzzle slowly, but as you will see the curve was admittedably more steep than I intended.

        <a id="puzzle2"><h2>Puzzle 2 - Cheshire's Pyramid</h2></a>
<br>
              The second location is Cheshire's Pyramid (the Sand structure). Off to the north is a Jojo song made with noteblocks (a Familiar Tune), <br>
              and there you can see a lone 5 blocks tall cactus (the Lone suspicious plant). Not only is that the only cactus within around a 50 blocks radius,<br>
              but also in Minecraft, cacti can only naturally grow up to 3 blocks tall. Digging under the tall cactus reveal a ladder down to an underground room.<br><br>

    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OKSU5wP.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
   <br>
    Inside the room is a 5x5 grid of assorted blocks on the floor, with a sign denoting the "Puzzle Rule". <br>
    The sign does read like a rule regarding breaking the puzzle, but it seems that there's only one sign with one rule.<br><br>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ua0jFi.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Goud4bM.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
    As it turns out, the "Puzzle Rule" actually contains three rules in one sign --- one of them even is a clue to how to solve this puzzle.
    <br><br>
    Taking the name of all the blocks in reading order, and looking at their FIRST letter, spells out the phrase "BOOK DOWN BELOW STICKY PISTION"
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SZ8qP6Y.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    Digging a few blocks below the Sticky Piston reveals a chest with another book inside it.<br><br>

        <a id="puzzle3"><h2>Puzzle 3 - T00BAD's Trade Hall</h2></a>
<br>
              The third location is T00BAD's Trade Hall. (TOO BAD you won't find it on a shore). <br>
              At the end of one hallway, there is a Silk Touch villager (a gentle touch at the end of the hall) with a block of sand next to it (Beneath the sand).<br>
              Below the sand is an entrance to a hidden cave.<br><br>
              <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Ww9UiK.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RQmR6PE.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zzuesTg.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
              Inside the cave you can find a couple of things, though this section will only be showing what is relevant to this puzzle, <br>
the first one of which is this room right next to the entrance.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/faMcY72.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
This room seems to feature a type of encoding involving coloured banners. Each banner has two side for two colour<br> (though some do have the same colour on both sides).<br>
Without knowing how to decode the colours, you would make no progress here. So you explore the cave further.<br>
While looking around the cave, you might have encountered this chest. If you open it up, there's nothing in the chest, <br>
but you would see that the chest is named "There are banners outside".<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rnNTaVk.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RymeLFv.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
Going outside of the Trade Hall and around the back, you will find this set of banners behind the Trade Hall building.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dIh1NSz.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
This is the key to decode the coloured banners. Each colour correspond to a letter, and each banner is encoding a pair of letter.<br>
In the case that it's a solid colour, that means it's encoding the same letter twice.<br>
Substituting each colour with its corresponding letter reveals the phrase "BEENEATH THE FLOOR HIVE".
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q756GPi.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
If you are familiar with the village area around the Trade Hall, you might recall this beehive sitting on the ground here, not too far from the hall itself.<br>
Digging below the hive reveals yet another chest containing yet another book which has yet another hint for another location. You probably get the format of this round now.<br><br>

        <a id="puzzle4"><h2>Puzzle 4 - Lokey's base</h2></a>
<br>
              The next location is at Lokey's base. (A tower with a cute little face, not too far from the "first place", which is the Community House). <br>
    The clue tells you to look for "an out of place Spruce tree". If you look around carefully, you can see this Spruce tree amongst the Dark Oak forest.<br><br>
     <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/STbTkdR.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8EnNCSC.png" width=960 height=508/></div>

<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dx4inuI.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>   

Below the tree is a room with a 7x7 grid of signs, each with a pair of letters. You're probably going to exctract something out of this grid.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gd9KKFj.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>   
Previously, I did mention that the secret cave has a few things, though I only showed what's related to the previous puzzle.<br>
Inside that same cave is another room you might have found --- in it is another 7x7 grid, this times with a few labeled signs.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CM96RP.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>   
There are two different sets of signs being labeled here --- one with numbers, and the other with letters.<br>
They seems to be marking positions on the other grid, except that if you just apply the positions directly, all you get is a bunch of gibberish.<br>
While you're trying to figure out what's going on, you might have noticed the corners of the grid, and how they are the same blocks but in different orientations.<br>
So, what you have to do is flip one of the grid along the Granite-Dirt diagonal axis before indexing the positions.<br>
Doing so reveals the two phrases to be "X NEGATIVE FIVE ONE FOUR" and "Z NEGATIVE FOUR FIVE THREE", which is a coordinates.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VcwQkv6.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br> 
Going to the given coordinate leads to a chest hidden at the bottom of a small lake.<br><br>

        <a id="puzzle5"><h2>Puzzle 5 - W33bTr45h's island</h2></a>
<br>
              The next location is at W33bTr45h's island. (The one who charts our connection, as he is the one responsible for the Nether Link map). <br>
    Going off the dock, and diving straight down will lead you to a hidden room.<br><br>

    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RKdS9oU.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

This room contains 27 signs, divided into rows of 3. Each sign contains a clue with a blank that solves into a single word.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/huzOguL.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>   
Solving the clues for each row reveals that in every row, two of the three clues will have the same answer.<br>
Taking the answer that does not matches in each row in order forms the phrase "TREE WITH BEE NEST ON ISLAND TO THE WEST".<br><br>
<pre>
    TREE  	    (Happy ____ Friends)        // TIME (No ____ to Relax/It's ____ to D-D-D-DUEL!)

Sailing from W33b's island toward the west leads you two a small island with a couple of trees.<br>
On the island, there is one single tree that has a beehive on it. Under that tree is the next book.<br><br>

        <a id="puzzle6"><h2>Puzzle 6 - Neon's castle</h2></a>
<br>
              The next location is at Neon's castle. (Monument topped by a rabbit (Peko), with two ducks at the front). <br><br>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OcyjX6w.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
    Inside both the duck statues is a map. The premise of this is that, one of this map is real, and the other leads to a fake location.<br><br>
     <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VIYMrsL.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lQs4zvp.png" width=960 height=508/></div>

        <p class="text-muted">The right map, inside the right duck.</p><br><br>

The right map leads to a little room in the middle of the forest at (0 / -643).<br>
Inside the rooms are nine coloured banners, which is a callback to the second puzzle, where you decode coloured banners.<br><br>
  <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bZrBn8N.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j67lyA2.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
Decoding the banners here gives the phrase "THE OTHER ONE NOT HERE", meaning that this is the fake map.
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wHrgae2.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br><br>

The left map leads to a little room in the middle of the forest at (-766 / -385). Inside this room is yet another callback banner puzzle.<br><br>

<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ts6Ndoz.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
Decoding the banners here gives the phrase "NINETEEN TO THE NORTH"
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cufG0LI.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

Going 19 blocks to the north from where the banner is, and digging there reveals the chest for the next book.<br><br>

<br>
              The next location is at Cheshire's base. While the poem does somewhat vaguely describe Cheshire's base,<br>
    if you look closely, you will see that the first letter of each line spells out "CHESHIRE".
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LN1ORge.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
    Arriving at the place, you are told to look for something on the ground.<br>
Not too far off from the portal right near the pumpking farm, there is an arrow.<br>
Follow the direction of the for 60 blocks and you'll find the entrance of the next location.<br><br>

<br>

In this room is a Knight's tour puzzle, with the restraint of having to visit the checkpoints in order.<br><br>
  <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0cRv4im.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W88Kfwt.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
In the chest that was labled to be there to give you carpets to help you with the puzzle, you can see a URL in the chest's name.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f8aIf9s.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yQw0cy9.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
The URL given goes to a grid of letters the same size as the Knight's tour puzzle.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I5hrwc1.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
You may also see the hold behind the chest. If you dig behind the chest, you'll see this sign.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OW2Sro1.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ueplCRt.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br><br>

Pictured below is the Knight's tour puzzle and the solution path.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nyDky20.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eg0mZV0.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

Once again, the natural progression is to apply the solve path to the grid, however, like before, you'd get gibberish.<br>
The corners of the letter grid matches the corners of the room, except it has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise.<br>
Rotating the letter grid back 90 degrees counter-clockwise, THEN applying the Knight's tour path gives the phrase "THERES ANOTHER ARROW OFF TO THE NORTHEAST"<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DT8SOoV.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

If you go northeast from where the entrance to the room is for a bit, you'll see this arrow. On it is a sign that says "Go until you see a blue orchid".<br>
There is no book for this location, rather this IS the instruction that leads you to the next locaction.<br><br>

<br>
              Following the direction of the arrow until you find a blue orchid lead you to an area nearby Mion's place.<br><br>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/usOe3SA.png" width=960 height=508/></div>

    The flower is seems to be at the entrance of someone's base. However, if you are unfamiliar with the name of the person who supposedly live here,<br>
    there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. That is because this base is, in fact, fake and fabricated for the purpose of the hunt.<br><br>
   
Going down into the base, first you find the main room. It looks just like any other base, and even has items like someone would have in a real base.<br>
I spent a couple of days living there off stone tools just to make the base as authentic as I could've.<br><br>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i4BcQzP.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

Under the bed is a barrel, to keep valuable things hidden, like a real person would. Inside it is an unsigned book, supposedly a "note-to-self" type thing.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3w5J2HN.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y1XmVj5.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6hvCtKO.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

Going down further you'll reach the mine. There are two hallways off to the side, and one strip mine forward.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UQuFGiz.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3NPq87Q.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

The left hall leads to a mineshaft, which according to the book is where the "key" is.<br>
Along the wall you can see a long, suspicious looking strip of Clay blocks. Digging the Clay reveals a sequence of coloured wool, with an underscore and an apostrophe.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VzJ7oc0.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/grSx0fF.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

The right hall leads nothing, though the book does say this is where the "instruction" is.<br>
Along the wall you can see a small path blocked off by planks. Breaking it reveals a room with a bunch of wool on the floor.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CxOOTiB.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kvQMZQa.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QYibONQ.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

The sequence of wool in the left hall is the Key, as in the key to decode the message in the right hall.<br>
For keen solvers, the underscore and apostrophe in the sequence might ring a bell to you.<br>
As it turns out, those sequences maps onto the sign at the entrance of the base, which results in each colour being assigned a unique letter each.<br>
Using the colour key, you can decode the message as "PLACE REDSTOEN TORCH ON CRAFTING TABLE".<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2hgsU5H.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UCPcM5v.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
<p class="text-muted">NOTE : At the time this screenshot was taken, the top left block was black instead of blue. I only found out it was wrong as I was writing this. Although, with the rest of the message, you could probably figure out what it was supposed to be. Fortunately I did time to change it before the server went down, so if there's a world download available, it will have the correct block. </p><br><br>

Placing a Redstone Torch on the crafting table activates a hidden mechanism and reveal a secret room.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9uKGLaw.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kQ39BBe.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

Inside the room is this lone chest, with a book inside.<br><br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WX7sqYj.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RqXzpGI.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uy0l03q.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>

This marks the end of the first round of puzzles, and the start of the Runback intermission.
