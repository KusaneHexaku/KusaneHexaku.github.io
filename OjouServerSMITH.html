    During the first hour after the hunt was officially launched, I posted a screenshot showing me standing somewhere in a server waiting.<br>
    If they figure out where I was and come find me, I would direct them toward the first location, and they would get to skip solving this puzzle<br>.

Puzzle 0 is made as an alternative to finding me.<br>
        Each entry in the list is an anagram of something, but with an extra letter. If you remove all the extra letters, they should be able to be anagrammed back into something that belong to the same group.<br>
        And by the same group, I mean that these are all names of <b>Nijisanji Livers</b>.<br>
        Taking all the extra letters in order spells the phrase "COMMUNITY HOUSE".<br><br>

There are renamed coloured wool scattered all over the place. Each of them has a 2-letter name.<br>
      Inside the house, there is a section with a multicoloured "carpet".<br>
      The colours on the carpet matches the colour we found. Reordering them based on the colour order that isn't out.<br>
      Note that the position of each wool might get shuffled around, though the location of the wool has no impacts.<br>
