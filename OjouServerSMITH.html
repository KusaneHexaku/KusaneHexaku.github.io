<br>
    During the first hour after the hunt was officially launched, I posted a screenshot showing me standing somewhere in a server waiting.<br>
    If they figure out where I was and come find me, I would direct them toward the first location, and they would get to skip solving this puzzle.<br>

Puzzle 0 is made as an alternative to finding me.<br>
        Each entry in the list is an anagram of something, but with an extra letter. If you remove all the extra letters, they should be able to be anagrammed back into something that belong to the same group.<br>
        And by the same group, I mean that these are all names of <b>Nijisanji Livers</b>.<br>
        Taking all the extra letters in order spells the phrase "COMMUNITY HOUSE".<br><br>

There are renamed coloured wool scattered all over the place. Each of them has a 2-letter name.<br>
      Inside the house, there is a section with a multicoloured "carpet".<br>
      The colours on the carpet matches the colour we found. Reordering them based on the colour order that isn't out.<br>
      Note that the position of each wool might get shuffled around, though the location of the wool has no impacts.<br>

Hidden below the stair, there is a furnace visible through a tiny gap through the staircase. Inside it is a book that tells you where to go next.

    I decided to start it off focusing more on the scavenger hunt side than the puzzle side to give everyone an equal footing start.<br>
    I did try to ease into puzzle slowly, but as you will see the curve was admittedably more steep than I intended.

        <a id="puzzle2"><h2>Puzzle 2 - Cheshire's Pyramid</h2></a>
<br>
              The second location is Cheshire's Pyramid (the Sand structure). Off to the north is a Jojo song made with noteblocks (a Familiar Tune), <br>
              and there you can see a lone 5 blocks tall cactus (the Lone suspicious plant). Not only is that the only cactus within around a 50 blocks radius,<br>
              but also in Minecraft, cacti can only naturally grow up to 3 blocks tall. Digging under the tall cactus reveal a ladder down to an underground room.<br>

   <br>
    Inside the room is a 5x5 grid of assorted blocks on the floor, with a sign denoting the "Puzzle Rule". <br>
    The sign does read like a rule regarding breaking the puzzle, but it seems that there's only one sign with one rule.
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ua0jFi.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Goud4bM.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
    As it turns out, the "Puzzle Rule" actually contains three rules in one sign --- one of them even is a clue to how to solve this puzzle.
    <br><br>
    Taking the name of all the blocks in reading order, and looking at their FIRST letter, spells out the phrase "BOOK DOWN BELOW STICKY PISTION"
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SZ8qP6Y.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
    Digging a few blocks below the Sticky Piston reveals a chest with another book inside it.<br>

        <a id="puzzle3"><h2>Puzzle 3 - T00BAD's Trade Hall</h2></a>
<br>
              The third location is T00BAD's Trade Hall. (TOO BAD you won't find it on a shore). <br>
              At the end of one hallway, there is a Silk Touch villager (a gentle touch at the end of the hall) with a block of sand next to it (Beneath the sand).br>
              Below the sand is an entrance to a hidden cave.<br>
              <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Ww9UiK.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RQmR6PE.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
    <div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zzuesTg.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
              Inside the cave you can find a couple of things, though this section will only be showing what is relevant to this puzzle, <br>
the first one of which is this room right next to the entrance.<br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/faMcY72.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
This room seems to feature a type of encoding involving coloured banners. Each banner has two side for two colour (though some do have the same colour on both sides).<br>
Without knowing how to decode the colours, you would make no progress here. So you explore the cave further.<br>
While looking around the cave, you might have encountered this chest. If you open it up, there's nothing in the chest, <br>
but you would see that the chest is named "There are banners outside".
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rnNTaVk.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RymeLFv.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
Going outside of the Trade Hall and around the back, you will find this set of banners behind the Trade Hall building.<br>
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dIh1NSz.png" width=960 height=508/></div><br>
This is the key to decode the coloured banners. Each colour correspond to a letter, and each banner is encoding a pair of letter.<br>
In the case that it's a solid colour, that means it's encoding the same letter twice.<br>
Substituting each colour with its corresponding letter reveals the phrase "BEENEATH THE FLOOR HIVE".
<div class="img-fluid text-center "><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q756GPi.png" width=960 height=508/></div>
If you are familiar with the village area around the Trade Hall, you might recall this beehive sitting on the ground here, not too far from the hall itself.<br>
Digging below the hive reveals yet another chest containing yet another book which has yet another hint for another location. You probably get the format of this round now.
