      <h2>What Makes A Valid Connection?</h2>
      
      - Something factual, and reasonably concrete<br>
      - May be thematic or qualitative<br><br>
      - For qualitative connections, it can be something that is true about a lot of things, but NOT a universal given.<br>
      e.g. "They all contain an animal facing left", "The point numbers on all of them are prime", "All of them requires you to flip a coin"<br>
      - For thematic connections, it should be something that at least two other players at the table understands and can agree upon.<br>
      e.g. "StephenVlogs titles", "References to the Ocarina of Time let's play", ""Things Stephen have hidden at the back of his closet", "Nintendo Games"
     <br><br>
     - It should be a little less obvious while not being overly esoteric, preferably leaning toward the latter.<br>
     e.g. "People on this channel" is too obvious, while "Things Stephen tried to eat while getting interrupted by Mal on the Breakfast Stream" is way too obtuse.<br>
     - Connections are NOT reserved only to things related to the channel. As long as it is a decent connection and the table agrees with you, then anything is fair game.<br>
     e.g. "Rick and Morty characters", "They all reference Superbowl", "They all have cheese related puns"<br><br>
     
     - Optional : Watch a couple episodes of Only Connect. You'll get a feel for how it's suppose to work.<br><br>
